  <p> Michaela Kent is a PhD candidate in the Neuroscience Graduate Program at Western University in London, Ontario, Canada. She is based at the Western Institute for Neuroscience and is co-supervised by [Dr. Emma Duerden](https://www.developingbrain.ca/) and [Dr. Jody Culham](http://www.culhamlab.com/).

Her interest in the developing brain has been a driving factor behind previous work. During her undergraduate degree, Michaela wrote a dissertation focussed on the neurodevelopment of children raised in orphanages. She then completed a Master's degree in Brain Science at the University of Glasgow, working primarily on a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study exploring aspects of social cognition. Whilst in Glasgow, Michaela worked with [Dr. Ruud Hortensius](http://www.ruudhortensius.nl/) and as part of the [Social Brain in Action Lab](https://www.so-bots.com/) on the ERC-funded Social Robots research project. Building on her neuroimaging background, Michaela is now using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to study the developing brain in naturalistic settings. Specifically, she uses fNIRS and behavioural measures to study how socio-cognitive skills develop and how brain responses to social interactions might be influenced by the environment. 

Outside of her research, Michaela has been actively involved in the [Society of Neuroscience Graduate Students](https://songsuwo.ca/execs) and has worked as a graduate teaching assistant in Psychology at Western University.
